                <p>A Tunisia-based web developer who's down to learn something new everyday.</p>
                <p>Six years ago, ending up a web developer was nothing of what I've planned back then...</p>
                <p id="hidden-description">After studying biology in high-school, the initial and natural plan was to pursue chemical enginering in
                    university. But what happened was I rethought my carrer plans and digged deep into my real passions and
                    how intriguing computer science was to me. By exploring and combining my passion, purpose, and what I
                    really wanted, I started software engineering studies, and am most grateful for doing so. I have learnt
                    a lot ever since and develepod a true passion for web and mobile development. I have experienced life
                    abroad and I strive for diversity and enjoy working within multicultural teams.
                    <br> Please reach out to me through facebook, skype, linkedIn or Gmail to tell you more!
                    <br> Thanks for passing by !
